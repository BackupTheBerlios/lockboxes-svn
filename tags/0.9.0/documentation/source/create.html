<h2>Name</h2>

<p>lkb_create - create a lockbox on a shelf in the current vault</p>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre>
#include &lt;lockbox.h&gt;

lockbox_t lkb_create(	int <var>shelf</var>,
			char const *<var>name</var>,
			char const *<var>data</var>,
			char const *<var>size</var>,
			lockbox_acl const *<var>acl</var>);
</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
	lkb_create creates a lockbox on the specified <var>shelf</var> in the current
	vault. If <var>name</var> is given, it is the name of the new lockbox. If
	<var>name</var> is NULL, the system will assign a name to the lockbox of the form
	"#nnnnnnnn" where "nnnnnnnn" is a series of hexadecimal digits. The name can be
	retrieved using <a href="getname.html">lkb_getname</a>.
</p>

<p>
	If <var>size</var> is not NULL, <var>data</var> is a pointer to a buffer containing
	<var>size</var> bytes that will populate the initial data in the lockbox's data
	area.
</p>

<p>
	If <var>acl</var> is not NULL, it contains the initial access control list for
	the lockbox. If <var>acl</var> is NULL, the initial access control list of the
	box will give the user indicated by the current effective user ID LKB_ACCESS_ALL,
	and gives all users LKB_ACCESS_READ and LKB_ACCESS_OPEN.
</p>

<p>
	Shelves allow applications that are using lockboxes to group their lockboxes
	according to their data structure and purpose. By doing this, applications that
	are seeking a lockbox containing data of a particular type can use
	<a href="listboxes.html">lkb_listboxes</a> to search through the available
	lockboxes on the shelf for that type of data.
</p>

<p>
	Lower values of <var>shelf</var> are to be preferred because they are faster to
	access. When a vault is initially created, a fixed number of shelves (the number
	is system-dependent) are created with it. The lowest numbered shelf is shelf 0.
	Additional shelves are allocated in groups of some system-dependent constant
	number of shelves.  When you add a box to a shelf that does not yet exist, that
	shelf is created together with any lower numbered shelves not yet created, and
	possibly some more higher numbered shelves.
</p>

<p>
	Applications using lockboxes should accordingly use shelf numbers starting at 0
	and increasing by 1 without any gaps.
</p>

<h2>Return Value</h2>

<p>
	On success, lkb_create returns a lockbox handle. On failure, it returns
	LOCKBOX_ERROR.
