<p>
	A process that will use lockboxes must first open a vault. A vault is the top level
	container for lockbox data, and is used to ensure that applications that use
	lockboxes can be sure that no other applications will inadvertently conflict in
	their lockbox use. Each process can access only one vault at any one time -
	before attempting to open a second vault, the process must close its existing
	vault. Closing the vault will also close all lockbox handles open on the vault.
</p>
<p>
	Vaults are given a name. The name should be unique so that other applications
	that do not understand the purpose and use of lockboxes within a particular vault
	will not inadvertently open the vault.  One way of achieving this to include your
	domain name as the start of the vault name, and then using any additional
	information necessary to distinguish between applications, and separate instances
	of applications. For example, if instances have unique data directories
	associated with them, a unique lockbox name might be:
</p>

<pre>
example.com/Example Application/usr/local/example-app/data/default
</pre>

<p>
	Vaults are opened with <a href="openvault.html">lkb_openvault</a>. When the
	process has finished using the lockboxes in a vault, it should close the
	vault with <a href="closevault.html">lkb_closevault</a>. Vaults are created
	when the first process opens them and are destroyed when the last vault
	closes them.
</p>
<p>	A list of active vaults can be obtained using
	<a href="listvaults.html">lkb_listvaults</a>.
