__HEAD__:Accessing State Bits
__SEEA__:setstate.html

<p>
	A process that has a lockbox handle can use it to set the state bits on the
	lockbox by calling <a href="setstate.html">lkb_setstate</a> and retrieve the
	state bits from the lockbox by calling <a href="getstate.html">lkb_getstate</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The state bits are a 32 bit integer. The advantage they have over ordinary
	<a href="data.html">data</a> in a lockbox is that state bits can be tested
	using <u>select(2)</u> by setting appropriate selection criteria on the
	lockbox handle.
