	A process that has open lockboxes can set select criteria on its lockbox handles
	and then use the file descriptor returned by
	<a href="openvault.html">lkb_openvault</a> in a call to <u>select(2)</u>
	or to <u>poll(2)</u> to test if any of the criteria set on any of its lockboxes is
	met. It may also create a new file descriptor having a subset of its open lockbox
	together with select criteria on that subset.
</p>
<p>
	A single-threaded process will normally use
	<a href="resetallselects.html">lkb_resetallselects</a> to reset all select
	criteria, then make a series of calls to
	<a href="setselectcriterion.html">lkb_selectselectcriterion</a> to define the
	conditions that it is interested in, followed by a call to <u>select(2)</u> or
	<u>poll(2)</u> to wait for one of those conditions to be met. It may then call
	<a href="getselectableboxes.html">lkb_getselectableboxes.html</a> to identify
	which lockbox handles are ready.
</p>
<p>
	A multi-threaded process will instead use
	<a href="createselectfd.html">lkb_createselectfd</a> to create new file
	descriptors with handles to subsets of the lockboxes it has open and distinct
	sets of select criteria. The threads will still use its original lockbox handle to
	access the lockbox, but will use file descriptors created by this mechanism in
	calls to <u>select(2)</u> and <u>poll(2)</u>. By using this scheme each thread can
	call select on its own file descriptor using its own set of criteria.
</p>
<p>
	A process may set select criteria that test for the number of users of a lockbox
	being greater than or less than some number, for state bits being set, or for
	exclusive locks being available.
