__HEAD__:Lockbox Concepts

<h2>The lockbox organisational heirarchy</h2>
<p>
	Lockboxes are organised into a heirarchy that aims to facilitate organisation of
	the data in the lockboxes. At the top level of the heirarchy are named vaults.
	Each vault contains numbered shelves. Each shelf contains named lockboxes. Each
	lockbox can contain some data, a file, and some state bits.
</p>

<h2>Vaults</h2>
<p>
	Before an application can use lockboxes it must open a vault. An application can
	only have one vault open at a time. By using an appropriate name for a vault,
	applications using the vault can ensure that their use of lockboxes will not
	conflict with the use of lockboxes by applications using another vault.
</p>
<p>
	Vaults are created automatically when the first process opens a vault of that
	name and are destroyed automatically when the last process closes it.
</p>

<h2>Shelves</h2>
<p>
	Within each vault there are numbered shelves. When a vault is initially created,
	it will have some fixed number of shelves already in it. When an application
	creates a lockbox on a shelf that does not already exist, that shelf is created,
	as are any lower numbered shelves that have not yet been created, and in most
	cases a small number of higher numbered shelves.
</p>
<p>
	Shelf numbers are numbered starting at zero, and lower numbered shelves are more
	efficient to access than higher numbered shelves.
</p>
<p>
	An application that stores multiple data structures in lockboxes might store the
	lockboxes in shelves that reflect the type of data in the lockbox. Alternatively,
	each process using a vault might be assigned a shelf, with lockboxes in shelf 0
	being used to manage the assignment of processes to a shelf, and processes only
	permitted to create lockboxes in their own shelf. The use of shelves is a matter
	for the application design, but should reflect the fact that lower numbered
	shelves are quicker to access than higher numbered shelves.
</p>

<h2>Lockboxes</h2>
<p>
	The lockbox is the basic organisational structure in the lockbox API. Each
	lockbox is on a shelf, and is given a name that is unique on that shelf in the
	vault. The choice of name is a matter for the application design. Locking and
	access control in the API is applied at the lockbox level.
</p>
<p>
	When a lockbox is opened or created, the process gets a lockbox handle (also known
	as a lockbox ID). The process retains this handle for as long as it needs
	access to the lockbox. When all handles on a lockbox have been closed, the system
	automatically deletes the lockbox.
</p>
<p>
	Each lockbox can contain one or more of: data; a file; and state bits.
</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>
	Lockboxes can contain data. Processes with a handle to the lockbox can, if they
	have appropriate permission, set or retrieve data stored in the lockbox. Reads and
	writes to the data are atomic - a process reading data from a lockbox in a
	single read operation is guaranteed to receive data that is in a consistent state.
	A process that is writing data to a lockbox in a single operation will never cause
	the lockbox to contain data in the region being written that is a mixture of old
	data and new data.
</p>
<p>
	The amount of data in a lockbox can be expanded at any time by setting data at a
	location past the current end of the data in that lockbox. It is thus possible for
	a lockbox to expand to contain more data than was initially stored in it. Once
	expanded, however, the lockbox cannot be contracted. The memory allocated for the
	data can only be freed if all processes using that lockbox close their handles to
	it, thus causing the system to release it.
</p>

<h3>Files</h3>
<p>
	Each lockbox may contain one open file. A process with appropriate permission can
	store a file descriptor in the lockbox, allowing any other process that opens the
	lockbox and has appropriate permission to obtain a file descriptor to the same open
	file. The open file can be removed from the lockbox by any process with appropriate
	permission on the lockbox.
</p>

<h3>State Bits</h3>
<p>
	Each lockbox contains a set of state bits. Processes with appropriate permission
	can set or read the entire set of state bits. Additionally, processes can use
	select to determine when particular state bits have been set. Thus state bits
	can be used to trigger synchronization between processes.
</p>

<h2>Access Control</h2>
<p>
	Each lockbox has an access control list that can restrict who can open or lock
	a lockbox, and who can read or write any of the contents of the lockbox or the
	access control list itself. Access can be granted to process IDs, user IDs,
	group IDs, or to all users.
</p>

<h2>Locking</h2>
<p>
	A process using a lockbox may obtain a locks on any of the data, files, state bits
	and access control list. Only one process can have each type of lock at any one
	time, and the lock will cause any attempt by another process to modify the
	corresponding data element to fail.
</p>
<p>
	Because lockbox operations are guaranteed to be atomic, a process should only
	acquire lock if:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>It needs to read or write more than one of the content types in the lockbox
	    while ensuring the two or more content types are in a consistent state for the
	    two or more operations; or
	</li>
	<li>It needs to write a component with a value that depends on the immediate prior
	    contents of that component.
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Synchronization</h2>

<p>
	When an application opens a vault it obtains a file descriptor that can be used
	in calls to select to test whether a range of conditions are true. The application
	first uses the lockbox API to attach conditions to a lockbox handle. Once all the
	conditions are set, a call to select will report the file descriptor to have an
	exceptional condition when any of the conditions is true.
</p>
<p>
	The conditions that can be tested in this way are:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Test for particular state bits on a lockbox being set;</li>
	<li>Test for the number of users of the lockbox dropping below a number;</li>
	<li>Test for the number of users of the lockbox exceeding a number; and</li>
	<li>Test for the availability of one or more types of lock on the lockbox.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	A multi-threaded application can create additional file descriptors that can be
	used to test their own set of conditions independently of the conditions
	affecting the original file descriptor.
</p>
