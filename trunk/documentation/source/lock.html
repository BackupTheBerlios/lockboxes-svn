<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
	lkb_lock locks a lockbox to prevent changes to some combination of the data,
	the file, the state and the access control list. <var>id</var> is the handle
	to the lockbox. <var>flags</var> is a combination of the following flags:
</p>

<table border="0">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">
			LKB_LOCK_DATA
		</td>
		<td valign="top">
			Lock the data - prevents other users of the lockbox from
			calling <a href="setdata.html">lkb_setdata</a> on the lockbox.
		</td>
	</tr>

		<td valign="top">
			LKB_LOCK_FILE
		</td>

		<td valign="top">
			LKB_LOCK_STATE

<p>
	Applications should ensure that they do not hold locks on a lockbox any longer than
	is necessary - holding a lock for a long time increases the chances of another user
	of the lockbox blocking while attempting to obtain the lock.
</p>
<p>
	A preferred approach is to avoid requiring locks altogether. Each operation on a
	lockbox is guaranteed to obtain consistent data. A single call to
	<a href="getdata.html">lkb_getdata</a> has no risk of receiving data that has
	been only partially written by a call to <a href="setdata.html">lkb_setdata</a>
	by another user of the lockbox. Thus readers that only need read access to one
	attribute of the lockbox need not lock the box at all. Writers only need to lock
	the box if either they write multiple attributes of the lockbox or if they need
	to know the contents of the lockbox immediately prior to the change they are
	making.
</p>

<h2>Return Value</h2>

<p>
	On success, lkb_lock returns 0. On failure, it returns -1.
