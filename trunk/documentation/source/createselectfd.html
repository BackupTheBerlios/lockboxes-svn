<h2>Name</h2>

<p>lkb_createselectfd - create a file descriptor that can be used to test for a specific set of trigger conditions</p>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre>
#include &lt;lockbox.h&gt;

int lkb_createselectfd(	lockbox_select_fd_entry const *<var>entries</var>,
			size_t <var>count</var>);
</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
	lkb_createselectfd creates a new file descriptor that has a list of lockboxes and
	conditions that will cause the new file descriptor to satisfy the exceptional
	conditions test of select(2). It is used for multi-threaded applications where
	more than one thread may need to test lockbox conditions with select(2), with
	different sets of conditions.
</p>

<p>
	<var>entries</var> is an array of <var>count</var> lockbox_select_fd_entry
	structures, each of which contains a lockbox handle and a list of criteria to be
	tested. The use of this call will increase the user count for each lockbox with a
	handle in the array. The user count will drop when the file descriptor created by
	this call is closed.
</p>

<h2>Return Value</h2>

<p>
	On success, lkb_createselectfd returns the new file descriptor. On failure it
	returns -1.
