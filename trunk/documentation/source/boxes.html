<p>
	Before accessing a lockbox, a process must open a <a href="vaults.html">vault</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Once the vault is open, a process may open existing lockboxes within it by
	calling <a href="open.html">lkb_open</a>, and create new lockboxes by calling
	<a href="create.html">lkb_create</a>. A lockbox is identified within a vault by
	the shelf number the lockbox is on and the name of the lockbox. The lockbox name
	is only unique within a shelf - two lockboxes on separate shelves may have the
	same name, but are not necessarily related.
</p>
<p>
	When creating a lockbox, it is possible to ask the operating system to assign it
	a unique name, and then retrieve the name with
	<a href="getname.html">lkb_getname</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The lockbox can also be given initial <a href="data.html">data</a> and an
	initial <a href="acls.html">access control list</a> in the call to
	<a href="create.html">lkb_create</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Once a process opens or creates a lockbox, it retains a lockbox handle to it until
	it closes either the lockbox or the vault. The lockbox is guaranteed to continue
	to exist at least as long as the process holds the lockbox handle. The handle can
	be used to read data from and write data to the lockbox, to set or retrieve the
	lockbox's file, to set or retrieve its state bits, to set or retrieve its access
	control list, and to set its selection criteria.
</p>
<p>
	When a process has finished using a lockbox, it should close the handle. When the
	last process using a lockbox closes it, the system will destroy that lockbox.
