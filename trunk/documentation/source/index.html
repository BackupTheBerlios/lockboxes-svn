__HEAD__:Introduction to Lockboxes

<p>
	Lockboxes are an experimental high performance inter-process communication (IPC)
	mechanism with access control. A lockbox can be used to share data, an open file
	handle, and state flags, with access control defining which users, groups or
	processes may have access to those shared elements.
</p>
<p>
	Lockboxes share similarities with several other IPC mechanisms, including shared
	memory, semaphores, and UNIX domain sockets, and it it possible to implement
	other IPC mechanisms including semaphores, mutexes, pipes, mailslots, and UNIX
	domain pipes by using lockboxes.
</p>
<p>
	Lockboxes differ from these other mechanisms in that they provide a secure, high
	performance and failure resistant way to make data and files available to other
	processes without knowing when those other processes might need to access that
	data and without having to rendezvouz with that process to effect the transfer.
</p>
<p>
	Each process that uses lockboxes can attach to a single named vault. A vault
	contains numbered shelves, which can be used by co-operating applications to group
	lockboxes containing the same or similar data structures. Each shelf contains an
	arbitrary number of named lockboxes. Each lockbox has its own access control list
	(ACL) and contains a block of data, a file, and a set of state bits. A process can,
	if it has permission, set or query the data, file, ACL, and state, lock any of
	these to temporarily prevent writes by any other process, and may use select to
	determine if any of several conditions is true on one or more lockboxes that it has
	open.
