__HEAD__:Installing the Lockbox API

<p>
	The lockbox API requires version 2.6 of the Linux kernel. You will need to have
	this installed together with the kernel headers.
</p>
<p>
	To build the lockbox API, simply run "make" as a mortal user, then "make install"
	as root. After that, just make sure "lockbox" appears in /etc/modules.
