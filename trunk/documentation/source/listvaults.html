<h2>Name</h2>

<p>lkb_listvaults - list all vaults currently open on the system</p>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<pre>
#include &lt;lockbox.h&gt;

int lkb_listvaults(	char const *<var>data</var>,
			size_t <var>bufsize</var>,
			size_t *<var>sizeneeded</var>);
</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
	lkb_listvaults lists all vaults currently open on the system. <var>data</var> is a
	buffer to hold the names of the vaults, and <var>bufsize</var> is the size of the
	buffer. The call stores the number of bytes used to hold the names in the value
	pointed to by <var>sizeneeded</var>.
</p>
<p>
	The names are stored in the buffer pointed to by <var>data</var> as a series of
	strings. Each string begins after the terminating NUL byte of the previous string.
	An empty string appears after the last string in the buffer.
</p>
<p>
	If <var>bufsize</var> is not large enough to store the list of names,
	lkb_listvaults stores the number of bytes needed in the value pointed to by
	<var>sizeneeded</var>, returns -1, and sets <u>errno</u> to ENOMEM.
</p>
<p>
	It is not necessary to have a vault open in order to use lkb_listvaults, but if
	one is open it must not be closed by another thread while lkb_listvaults is
	being used.
</p>

<h2>Return Value</h2>

<p>
	On success, lkb_listvaults returns 0. On failure, it returns -1.
