<p>
	A process that has a lockbox handle can use it to set the file in the lockbox by
	calling <a href="setfile.html">lkb_setfile</a> and retrieve the file from the
	lockbox by calling <a href="getfile.html">lkb_getfile</a>.
</p>
<p>
	A process can deposit a file in a lockbox by providing any open file descriptor
	to it with <a href="setfile.html">lkb_setfile</a>. When a process retrieves the
	file from the lockbox with <a href="getfile.html">lkb_getfile</a>, it receives
	a new file descriptor to the open file and can access that file as if it had opened
	the file itself. When it has finished using the file, it should close the file
	by calling <u>close(2)</u>.
</p>
<p>
	The file can be removed from the lockbox by calling
	<a href="setfile.html">lkb_setfile</a> with a file descriptor "-1".
