<p>
	A process that has a lockbox handle can use it to set data in the lockbox by
	calling <a href="setdata.html">lkb_setdata</a> and read data from the lockbox
	by calling <a href="getdata.html">lkb_getdata</a>. Each call takes an offset in
	bytes from the start of the lockbox, a buffer containing (or to receive) the data,
	and a number of bytes to copy into or out of the lockbox.
</p>
<p>
	If a process sets data past the end of the current data in the lockbox, the
	size of the data in the lockbox is expanded to accommodate the new data. If the
	offset supplied to <a href="setdata.html">lkb_setdata</a> is past the end of the
	existing data, and bytes between the old end of the data and the offset will be
	zero.
</p>
<p>
	When reading data using <a href="getdata.html">lkb_getdata</a>, any attempt to read
	data past the end of the data in the lockbox will return only the number of bytes
	available from the offset supplied. If the offset is past the end of the data in
	the lockbox, <a href="getdata.html">lkb_getdata</a> will return zero and will not
	return any data at all.
</p>
<p>
	A single call to <a href="getdata.html">lkb_getdata</a> or
	<a href="setdata.html">lkb_setdata</a> is atomic -
	<a href="getdata.html">lkb_getdata</a> will never return data that has been
	partially written by <a href="setdata.html">lkb_setdata</a> and partly contains
	old data that is still to be overwritten by the same call. When two processes
	both write to the same data area with <a href="setdata.html">lkb_setdata</a>, the
	overlapping area of the data in the lockbox will contain data written by one call
	or the other, but never a mix of partial data from each call.
</p>
<p>
	A process can query the size of the data in a lockbox with
	<a href="size.html">lkb_size</a>.
